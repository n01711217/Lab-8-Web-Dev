NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API

The NASA APOD API provides a daily image or photograph of 
space along with a brief description. 
I found it interesting because it offers beautiful and educational content 
about our universe. Each day, you can see a new picture and learn something 
new about astronomy. This API is simple to use and makes it easy to 
display captivating space images on a webpage.
